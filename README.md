 BIKE SHARE DATA INVESTIGATION 

For this project, my goal is to ask and answer three questions about the available bikeshare data from Washington, Chicago, and New York. This notebook can be submitted directly through the workspace when you are confident in your results.

I graded against the project Rubric by a mentor after I have submitted.

In this project I didnt use New York data. 

 FILES USED 

* chicago.csv
* washington.csv
* new_york_city.csv
